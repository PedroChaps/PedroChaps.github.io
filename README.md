# My website

Welcome to the README of my website! :D

I've always seen beautiful websites scattered across the internet and one of my dreams was to have one.  

So, in the university summer break of 2022, inspired by one of my classes' project and by coursemates websites (like @diogotcorreia [website](https://diogotc.com/) and  @jjasferreira [website](https://github.com/jjasferreira/my-website)) and the beautiful websites I've seen on the web, I decided to learn Web Development and create my personal website!  

Since I have pratically 0 experience with web styling, I'll document: 
- a roadmap that I had previously created some time before starting;
- a "step-by-step" journey / timeline of everything of what I learned, where I learned and how I used what I learned;
- a general / technical overview of the website, where I explain stuff like the frameworks used;

This way, I'll help myself by writting down everything I've done and my ideas as well as other people who intend to create a website themselves and are as lost as I was when I first started.   
I'm obviously no where near a professional, but I'll do my best to explain what I did and the decisions I took.

# Timeline of what I did

## 0. My background in WebDev

First, I think it is important to state what my background is in Web Development.  
Before this project, I had only done 2 other projects related to web:  

1. A web app using the Django Framework to interact with APIs.  
    Here I learned the basics of HTML and went straight to Bootstrap without giving a look to CSS, however the main focus was the app itself any not styling the website, so I didn't really learn much.
    
2. A web app using the Flask Framework to interact with a database.  
    One of my classes' project was to do many things related to a database. Since I was the only member of the group with prior experience of the group, I was in charge of the web app that was required.  
    I re-used the same principles of the first app: I used bootstrap for the design and some html "stolen" from the classes slides and, once again, the main objective was using the interaction with the database and not the style itself, so I didn't learn much about styling.
   
## 1. The Basics  

Since my knownledge was really low, I started by learning the basics: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

However, I decided to not put much effort into it - Since I understood the ideas, had some small prior experience and was expecting to use frameworks for CSS and JavaScript, I decided that only reading about the basics would suffice, without really applying what I had learned.  

So, what I did was read the [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) guides: [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), by that order.  

## 2. Choosing frameworks

Having read the basics, it was time to choose a framework for CSS and JavaScript.  
Although it wasn't necessary to, I decided that learning a bit of everything wouldn't hurt so I forced myself to use frameworks.

### CSS - Tailwind

Even though I had mentioned that "went straight to Bootstrap without giving a look to CSS", I still wanted to use a CSS framework.  
From the dozens that are available, I was kind of lost on which to use.  
I had already excluded Bootstrap because I wanted to learn something new and Bootstrap wasn't that customizable.  
So by googling a bit and following @jjasferreira 's idea I decided to use Tailwind.  

From what I gathered, Tailwind is highly customizable - it's like writing pure CSS but faster (and not using pre-built complex classes) - but also has some neat features, like Dark Mode, components, etc.  

### Javascript - React  

This was a though one to choose.  
I'll be honest and say that it was a kind of random choice.  
I had already seen some videos of people using three.js for 3d graphics and since React has a "Reach Three Fiber" that is a renderer for three.js, I decided to learn this framework.


## 3. Learn the frameworks

Having chosen the frameworks, it was time to learn them! 
This time I decided to see videos instead of reading about the content. I watched the following videos:
